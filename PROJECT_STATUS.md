# Project Status Report

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-26  
**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Phase**: Foundation Building - AGI Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

The Jarvis AGI Agent System is currently in the foundational phase of development, focused on building infrastructure specifically designed for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requirements. We have successfully established the core infrastructure with real-time capabilities, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline, and distributed computing foundation.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Real-time Performance**: Meeting strict latency requirements (< 100ms perception) across distributed systems
2. **Cognitive Layer Coordination**: Managing complex interactions between consciousness, reasoning, knowledge, and perception layers
3. **Distributed Consensus**: Achieving coherent world models and memory across multiple AGI instances
4. **Emergent Behavior**: Detecting and managing unexpected behaviors from complex system interactions
5. **Hardware Acceleration**: Efficient utilization of GPU/TPU resources for neural computations

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Prototype each component separately before integration
2. Use established patterns from distributed systems
3. Implement comprehensive integration tests early
