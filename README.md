A modular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) agent system implementing a four-layer cognitive architecture (consciousness, reasoning, knowledge, perception) with real-time performance, distributed computing, and neural-symbolic hybrid processing. Designed to achieve true AGI capabilities similar to Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S.

## 🚀 Project Status

### Current Phase: Foundation Building - AGI Infrastructure (Alpha v0.1.0)

- ✅ **Core Infrastructure** - Base classes and interfaces established
- ✅ **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions automation configured
- ✅ **Distributed Computing** - AGI-optimized with real-time scheduling
- 🔄 **AGI Infrastructure** - Real-time scheduling, hardware acceleration, cognitive bus
- 📋 **Memory System** - Distributed coherence, < 10ms access latency planned
- 📋 **Reasoning Engine** - Neural-symbolic hybrid, < 50ms System 1 planned

## 📋 Features

### Implemented
- **Modular Architecture**: Abstract base classes for agents, tools, memory, and protocols
- **Distributed Task Queue**: Celery integration with Redis backend
- **AGI-Optimized Distributed Computing**: 
  - Priority-based task scheduling with < 100ms latency support
  - Dynamic worker pools with auto-scaling
  - Real-time scheduling for perception tasks
  - Distributed coordinator for intelligent task distribution
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations with MyPy checking
- **Testing Suite**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and deployment
- **Docker Support**: Containerized development and deployment

### In Development
- **AGI-Specific Infrastructure**:
  - Real-time scheduling framework (< 100ms perception)
  - Distributed consensus protocol (CRDT-based)
  - Hardware acceleration layer (GPU/TPU/NPU)
  - Inter-layer cognitive communication bus
- **Unified Cognitive Architecture Coordinator**
- **Monitoring and logging framework**
- **Advanced configuration management system**

### Planned AGI Components
- **Reasoning and Decision Module**: 
  - System 1 (Neural): < 50ms response time for intuitive reasoning
  - System 2 (Symbolic): < 500ms for deliberative reasoning
  - Meta-reasoning for self-awareness and consciousness integration
- **Distributed Memory System**:
  - Working memory: < 10ms access, 7±2 items limit
  - Short-term memory: < 50ms retrieval
  - Long-term memory: < 200ms search
  - CRDT-based distributed coherence
- **Real-Time Perception**: 
  - All modalities < 100ms total latency
  - Edge computing deployment
  - Hardware acceleration support
- **Distributed World Model**:
  - Multi-agent belief reconciliation
  - < 200ms update propagation
  - < 100ms causal inference
- **Cognitive Architecture**:
  - Four-layer hierarchy: consciousness, reasoning, knowledge, perception
  - Real-time event-driven coordination
  - Emergent behavior detection
