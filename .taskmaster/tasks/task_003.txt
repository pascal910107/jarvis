# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Memory and Knowledge Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Provides the agent's long-term and short-term memory functions for storing and retrieving all task-related information, allowing the agent to accumulate experience and become more knowledgeable and efficient over time. Supports distributed AGI deployment with real-time performance constraints and multi-agent memory sharing.
# Details:
The memory system is composed of working memory (short-term) and long-term memory in a distributed architecture. Working memory temporarily stores the current conversation context, recent observations, and intermediate reasoning results with < 10ms access latency. Long-term memory persistently stores general knowledge, lessons learned, and past task records across distributed nodes. The module provides read/write interfaces for the Reasoning Module to access memories with coherence guarantees. It implements memory consolidation and compression mechanisms to extract key knowledge, eliminate redundancy, and prevent unlimited memory growth. Includes distributed consistency protocols, real-time access constraints, and multi-agent memory sharing capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Memory capacity tests for each layer, retrieval accuracy tests with various similarity metrics, consolidation tests simulating offline processing, forgetting mechanism validation, distributed coherence tests, latency benchmarks (working memory < 10ms, short-term < 50ms, long-term < 200ms), and multi-node synchronization tests.
