# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Memory and Knowledge Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Provides the agent's long-term and short-term memory functions for storing and retrieving all task-related information, allowing the agent to accumulate experience and become more knowledgeable and efficient over time.
# Details:
The memory system is composed of working memory (short-term) and long-term memory. Working memory temporarily stores the current conversation context, recent observations, and intermediate reasoning results. Long-term memory persistently stores general knowledge, lessons learned, and past task records. The module provides read/write interfaces for the Reasoning Module to access memories. It also implements memory consolidation and compression mechanisms to extract key knowledge, eliminate redundancy, and prevent unlimited memory growth.

# Test Strategy:
Memory capacity tests for each layer, retrieval accuracy tests with various similarity metrics, consolidation tests simulating offline processing, and forgetting mechanism validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement sensory memory buffer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a high-capacity, short-duration buffer for incoming sensory data with rapid decay
### Details:
Implement a circular buffer system that stores raw sensory inputs for 0.5-4 seconds before decay. Include multi-modal support for text, audio, and visual inputs with configurable buffer sizes and decay rates.

## 2. Build working memory with attention mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop an attention-based working memory system with limited capacity and active maintenance
### Details:
Create a 7Â±2 item capacity working memory using attention weights. Implement rehearsal mechanisms, interference handling, and integration with sensory buffer. Include attention scoring and item prioritization.

## 3. Create short-term conversational memory [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Design a conversation-aware memory system that maintains recent dialogue context
### Details:
Build a sliding window memory for conversations with entity tracking, topic continuity, and reference resolution. Include conversation turn management and context switching capabilities.

## 4. Develop episodic memory storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement a system for storing and retrieving specific experiences and events
### Details:
Create an event-based memory store with temporal indexing, context tagging, and similarity-based retrieval. Include episode boundaries, emotional salience, and reconstruction mechanisms.

## 5. Design semantic knowledge representation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Build a structured knowledge graph for facts, concepts, and relationships
### Details:
Implement a hierarchical knowledge representation with concept nodes, relationship edges, and attribute storage. Include inheritance, abstraction levels, and semantic similarity measures.

## 6. Implement procedural memory patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Create a system for storing and executing learned procedures and skills
### Details:
Build a pattern recognition and execution system for procedural knowledge. Include skill hierarchies, parameter adaptation, and performance optimization through practice.

## 7. Build memory encoding and retrieval system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Develop mechanisms for encoding new memories and retrieving existing ones
### Details:
Create encoding pathways from sensory to long-term memory with feature extraction and compression. Implement cue-based retrieval, spreading activation, and reconstruction algorithms.

## 8. Create consolidation mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.7
### Description: Implement memory consolidation processes for strengthening and integrating memories
### Details:
Build offline and online consolidation processes including replay mechanisms, memory trace strengthening, and integration across memory systems. Include sleep-like phases and memory reorganization.

## 9. Develop forgetting and pruning system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.7, 3.8
### Description: Design intelligent forgetting mechanisms for memory optimization and relevance
### Details:
Implement decay functions, interference-based forgetting, and active pruning strategies. Include relevance scoring, memory pressure management, and selective retention policies.
