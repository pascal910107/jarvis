# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Natural Interaction Interfaces
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an intuitive multi-modal interaction system with voice, text, gesture recognition, contextual awareness, and personalized adaptation.
# Details:
Implement natural language processing for conversational interactions with context awareness and dialogue management. Create a voice interface with speech recognition, NLU, and speech synthesis. Build gesture and facial expression recognition for non-verbal communication. Develop a contextual awareness system that understands user state, environment, and situational factors. Implement a personalization system that learns user preferences and communication styles. Create proactive interaction capabilities to provide timely assistance.

# Test Strategy:
Conversation quality tests with human evaluators, voice recognition accuracy in various conditions, gesture recognition precision tests, context understanding validation, and user satisfaction surveys.
