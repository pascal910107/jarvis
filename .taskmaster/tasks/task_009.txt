# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Multi-Layer Security, Safety, and Ethics Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a comprehensive security and safety system with Constitutional AI, behavior monitoring, human oversight, and emergency protocols to minimize risks and ensure trustworthy operation.
# Details:
Implement a multi-layer security architecture: 1) Hardcoded safety rules (immutable), 2) Constitutional AI for value alignment, 3) Behavior monitoring with anomaly detection, 4) Human supervision interfaces, and 5) Emergency stop protocols. This includes a decision tracking system, causal explanations for actions, uncertainty expression, comprehensive audit logging, and robust privacy protection mechanisms (data minimization, encryption, user control). The goal is to ensure the agent is safe, reliable, and aligned with human values.

# Test Strategy:
Security penetration testing, value alignment validation with ethical scenarios, behavior monitoring accuracy tests, human oversight interface usability tests, and privacy compliance audits.
