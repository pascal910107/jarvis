# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Self-Evolution and Improvement System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 7, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement controlled self-modification capabilities with a Constitutional AI framework, recursive improvement, and capability expansion mechanisms, ensuring the system evolves safely and effectively.
# Details:
Build a Constitutional AI framework with predefined, non-overridable ethical and behavioral guidelines. Implement a self-criticism system to evaluate output quality against internal standards. Create a self-improvement mechanism that optimizes behavior based on feedback within strict safety boundaries. Develop limited, safe code self-modification for performance optimization. Implement dynamic architecture adjustment and a capability expansion system that acquires new skills while ensuring alignment with core values.

# Test Strategy:
Constitutional constraint validation tests, self-improvement effectiveness measurement, code modification safety tests, and long-term stability monitoring.
