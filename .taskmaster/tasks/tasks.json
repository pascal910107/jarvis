        "description": "Implement the overarching system coordinating all four cognitive layers (consciousness, reasoning, knowledge, perception) to achieve true AGI capabilities with real-time event-driven architecture and emergent behavior detection.",
        "details": "Design and implement a four-layer cognitive architecture framework with hierarchical coordination: 1) Consciousness Layer - Meta-cognitive capabilities for self-awareness, introspection, and high-level goal alignment. Implement consciousness state tracking, attention mechanisms, and meta-reasoning interfaces. 2) Reasoning Layer Integration - Create bidirectional communication protocols with the reasoning module (Task 2) for System 1/2 coordination and meta-reasoning feedback loops. 3) Knowledge Layer Integration - Interface with memory systems (Task 3) for cognitive state persistence, experience replay, and knowledge-guided decision making. 4) Perception Layer Integration - Connect with multi-modal perception (Task 4) for sensory integration and attention-driven perception filtering. Build an event-driven message bus using Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for inter-layer communication with <10ms latency. Implement cognitive state management with Redis for real-time state tracking and PostgreSQL for historical analysis. Create emergent behavior detection using pattern recognition algorithms and anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, LSTM autoencoders). Develop cognitive load balancing with dynamic resource allocation based on task complexity and available computational resources. Build self-awareness monitoring with introspection APIs, performance metrics, and consciousness level indicators. Implement graceful degradation strategies for layer failures with fallback mechanisms and partial functionality modes. Create comprehensive visualization tools using D3.js or Plotly for real-time cognitive state monitoring and debugging interfaces.",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests for each cognitive layer interface with mock implementations. Integration tests for inter-layer communication protocols measuring message latency (<10ms requirement). Consciousness state consistency tests with concurrent operations. Emergent behavior detection validation using synthetic behavioral patterns. Load balancing effectiveness tests under various cognitive load scenarios. Self-awareness accuracy tests comparing internal state reports with external observations. Failure injection tests for each layer to validate graceful degradation. End-to-end cognitive task execution benchmarks. Visualization tool usability tests with cognitive state replay capabilities. Performance benchmarks for real-time event processing throughput (>10,000 events/second).",
