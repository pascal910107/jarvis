# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Core Project Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and basic architectural framework for the AGI Agent system with real-time processing capabilities and distributed cognitive architecture support.
# Details:
Create a modular project structure to support the entire AGI architecture. Set up the Python/PyTorch environment, configure dependency management (e.g., Poetry/Pip), and establish robust logging and monitoring systems. Implement a flexible configuration management system for all modules (e.g., Planning, Reasoning, Memory, Perception, Action). Define abstract base classes and interfaces for core components to ensure modularity and extensibility. Set up a comprehensive testing framework (e.g., pytest) and a CI/CD pipeline for automated quality assurance. Build specialized infrastructure for real-time scheduling, distributed consensus, hardware acceleration, and inter-layer cognitive communication to support AGI-specific requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for configuration loading, integration tests for module discovery and loading, performance tests for basic system initialization and memory usage validation. Additional performance benchmarks for real-time scheduling latency, consensus protocol correctness tests, hardware acceleration unit tests, and integration tests for inter-layer communication.

<info added on 2025-06-26T17:23:01.483Z>
Successfully implemented a robust distributed computing infrastructure featuring:

The BaseWorker abstract class provides a foundation for all worker implementations with built-in status tracking, comprehensive metrics collection, and centralized error handling. This ensures consistent behavior across different worker types.

The TaskQueue implementation offers thread-safe priority queue functionality with automatic task expiration, configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and real-time statistics tracking for performance monitoring.

The Coordinator serves as the central orchestration hub, managing worker pool lifecycles, intelligent task distribution based on worker capabilities and current load, and aggregating results from distributed workers.

The WorkerPool system enables dynamic pool management with auto-scaling capabilities that respond to workload changes, continuous health monitoring with automatic worker restart on failure, and graceful scaling operations to prevent task loss.

Seamless integration with the existing Celery infrastructure ensures backward compatibility while allowing gradual migration to the new system. The implementation supports priority-based scheduling for critical tasks, automatic retry logic with configurable backoff strategies, comprehensive health checks with self-healing capabilities, and detailed metrics collection for monitoring and optimization.

All components are designed with thread safety as a core requirement, implement clean shutdown procedures to prevent data loss, and are covered by an extensive test suite including both unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.
