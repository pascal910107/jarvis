# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Core Project Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and basic architectural framework for the AGI Agent system.
# Details:
Create a modular project structure to support the entire AGI architecture. Set up the Python/PyTorch environment, configure dependency management (e.g., Poetry/Pip), and establish robust logging and monitoring systems. Implement a flexible configuration management system for all modules (e.g., Planning, Reasoning, Memory, Perception, Action). Define abstract base classes and interfaces for core components to ensure modularity and extensibility. Set up a comprehensive testing framework (e.g., pytest) and a CI/CD pipeline for automated quality assurance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for configuration loading, integration tests for module discovery and loading, performance tests for basic system initialization and memory usage validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project structure and repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Git repository, create directory hierarchy for modular architecture including core/, modules/, tests/, docs/, and config/ directories
### Details:
Set up .gitignore, README.md, LICENSE, and establish folder structure following Python best practices with __init__.py files and package organization

## 2. Configure development environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Python virtual environment, dependency management with poetry/pip, and development tools including linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks
### Details:
Create pyproject.toml or requirements.txt, configure black, flake8, mypy, and pre-commit configurations for code quality enforcement

## 3. Implement base abstract classes and interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Design and implement core abstract base classes for agents, tools, memory systems, and communication protocols that all modules will inherit from
### Details:
Create base classes in core/ directory including BaseAgent, BaseTool, BaseMemory, BaseProtocol with standard interfaces and abstract methods

## 4. Set up testing framework and structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Configure pytest framework with fixtures, mocks, and test organization for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing capabilities
### Details:
Create tests/ directory structure mirroring source code, implement base test fixtures, configure coverage reporting and test runners

## 5. Establish CI/CD pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tool for automated testing, linting, building, and deployment workflows
### Details:
Create workflow files for PR validation, automated testing on multiple Python versions, artifact building, and release automation

## 6. Design distributed computing infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Implement base infrastructure for distributed task execution including message queuing, worker pools, and coordination mechanisms
### Details:
Set up Celery/RQ or custom async task queue system, implement worker base classes, and design scalable task distribution patterns

## 7. Implement monitoring and logging framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Create centralized logging system with structured logs, metrics collection, and monitoring dashboards for system observability
### Details:
Configure Python logging with custom formatters, integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana, implement performance metrics collection

## 8. Build configuration management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop flexible configuration system supporting environment variables, config files, and runtime configuration updates for all modules
### Details:
Implement configuration loader supporting YAML/JSON/env formats, create config validation schemas, and establish configuration hierarchy patterns
