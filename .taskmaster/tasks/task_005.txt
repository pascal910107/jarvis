# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Goal Management, Planning, and Action Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: This module is responsible for receiving the final goal, breaking it down into executable sub-tasks, and converting the system's decisions into actual operations on the environment.
# Details:
It possesses human-like task decomposition and prioritization capabilities, arranging execution order based on relevance and urgency. For complex tasks, it generates multi-step plans (e.g., a tree-like task structure) and can dynamically update the plan based on feedback. The action execution component interfaces with various external 'tools' (e.g., web services, databases, robotic devices) to perform operations, ensuring the agent's intent is translated into real-world results.

# Test Strategy:
Planning correctness tests with various goal complexities, execution monitoring tests with simulated failures, replanning efficiency tests, and end-to-end task completion benchmarks.

# Subtasks:
