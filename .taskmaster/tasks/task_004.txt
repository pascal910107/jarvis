# Description: Implement unified multi-modal perception capabilities for text, vision, audio, and tactile inputs with CLIP-style cross-modal alignment, optimized for AGI real-time requirements with strict latency constraints.
# Details:
Develop text processing pipeline with NLP capabilities including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and semantic understanding (< 40ms latency). Implement computer vision module for image and video processing with object detection, scene understanding, and visual reasoning (< 50ms latency). Create audio processing system for speech recognition, music analysis, and environmental sound classification (< 30ms latency). Build tactile/haptic input processing for embodied interactions (< 20ms latency). Implement CLIP-style cross-modal alignment for unified representation learning. Create contextual understanding system that integrates multi-modal information for comprehensive scene interpretation. All perception pipelines must complete within < 100ms total latency. Include edge computing deployment options for local processing and hardware acceleration support (GPU/TPU/NPU).

# Test Strategy:
