# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Multi-Modal Perception and Integration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement unified multi-modal perception capabilities for text, vision, audio, and tactile inputs with CLIP-style cross-modal alignment.
# Details:
Develop text processing pipeline with NLP capabilities including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and semantic understanding. Implement computer vision module for image and video processing with object detection, scene understanding, and visual reasoning. Create audio processing system for speech recognition, music analysis, and environmental sound classification. Build tactile/haptic input processing for embodied interactions. Implement CLIP-style cross-modal alignment for unified representation learning. Create contextual understanding system that integrates multi-modal information for comprehensive scene interpretation.
