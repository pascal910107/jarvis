# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Reasoning and Decision Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: This is the system's 'brain,' responsible for fine-grained thinking, reasoning, and real-time decision-making for each task stage with AGI-level meta-cognitive capabilities. It ensures every action is logically sound, self-aware, and serves the long-term goal while meeting strict latency requirements.
# Details:
For each sub-task, this module will use its built-in logic engine (combining symbolic computation with neural networks like GPT models) to perform 'chain-of-thought' reasoning with real-time constraints. System 1 (Neural) provides intuitive reasoning under 50ms, while System 2 (Symbolic) handles deliberative reasoning under 500ms. The module includes meta-reasoning capabilities for self-monitoring, confidence estimation, and strategy selection. It analyzes task-relevant information, predicts consequences, evaluates plans, and selects optimal actions while maintaining consciousness layer integration for transparency and self-awareness. The system adapts its decision-making strategy dynamically while recording reasoning traces for continuous learning.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark tests for reasoning speed (System 1: <50ms, System 2: <500ms, Hybrid: <100ms) and accuracy, integration tests for neural-symbolic coordination, meta-reasoning validation tests, consciousness layer API tests, introspection capability tests, and validation using logical reasoning datasets and causal inference problems.
