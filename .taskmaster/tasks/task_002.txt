# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Reasoning and Decision Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: This is the system's 'brain,' responsible for fine-grained thinking, reasoning, and real-time decision-making for each task stage. It ensures every action is logically sound and serves the long-term goal.
# Details:
For each sub-task, this module will use its built-in logic engine (potentially combining symbolic computation with neural networks like GPT models) to perform 'chain-of-thought' reasoning. It analyzes task-relevant information, predicts the consequences of actions, evaluates the pros and cons of different plans, and selects the optimal action for the current situation. When the environment changes or new situations arise, the module adjusts its decision-making strategy to cope with dynamic conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark tests comparing reasoning speed and accuracy, integration tests for neural-symbolic coordination, validation tests using logical reasoning datasets and causal inference problems.
