# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement World Model and Causal Reasoning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive world model including physical, social, and causal models for environment understanding and future state prediction.
# Details:
Implement a physical world model using architectures like Dreamer/PlaNet for learning environment dynamics. Create a social model for understanding human behavior patterns and social norms. Develop a causal model that learns cause-effect relationships using structural causal modeling techniques. Build a prediction engine for forecasting future states and implement counterfactual reasoning for 'what-if' analysis. The model must continuously update with new observations.

# Test Strategy:
Physical prediction accuracy tests in simulated environments, social behavior prediction validation, causal relationship discovery tests, and counterfactual reasoning validation.

# Subtasks:

## 2. Create Social Behavior Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a model that captures and predicts social interactions, agent intentions, and multi-agent dynamics
### Details:
Build theory of mind components, social graph representations, intention recognition modules, and multi-agent behavior prediction. Include modeling of cooperation, competition, and communication patterns

## 3. Implement Causal Graph Learning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build algorithms to discover causal relationships between variables in the environment from observational and interventional data
### Details:
Implement causal discovery algorithms like PC, GES, or NOTEARS. Include structure learning, causal effect estimation, and handling of confounders. Support both discrete and continuous variables

## 4. Build Prediction Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create a unified prediction system that leverages physical, social, and causal models for multi-step forecasting
### Details:
Integrate world models with ensemble methods, implement rollout mechanisms, handle different prediction horizons, and combine predictions from multiple model types with appropriate weighting

## 5. Develop Counterfactual Reasoning Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Implement algorithms for counterfactual inference to answer 'what-if' questions about alternative actions or scenarios

### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Build comprehensive uncertainty estimation for all model components including epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty
### Details:
Implement Bayesian neural networks, ensemble uncertainty, prediction intervals, uncertainty propagation through causal graphs, and confidence calibration methods

## 8. Develop Model Visualization and Debugging Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7
### Description: Create interactive visualization and analysis tools for understanding, debugging, and explaining world model behaviors
