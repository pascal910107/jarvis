# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement World Model and Causal Reasoning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive world model including physical, social, and causal models for environment understanding and future state prediction, with support for distributed AGI synchronization and real-time multi-agent coordination.
# Details:
Implement a physical world model using architectures like Dreamer/PlaNet for learning environment dynamics. Create a social model for understanding human behavior patterns and social norms. Develop a causal model that learns cause-effect relationships using structural causal modeling techniques. Build a prediction engine for forecasting future states and implement counterfactual reasoning for 'what-if' analysis. The model must continuously update with new observations. Add distributed world model synchronization with <200ms propagation, <100ms causal inference, and <150ms prediction generation. Implement multi-agent belief reconciliation and consensus mechanisms for contradictory observations.

# Test Strategy:
Physical prediction accuracy tests in simulated environments, social behavior prediction validation, causal relationship discovery tests, counterfactual reasoning validation, distributed synchronization latency tests, multi-agent consensus accuracy tests, and contradiction resolution effectiveness tests.
