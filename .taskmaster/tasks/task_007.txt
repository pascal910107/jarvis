# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Continuous Learning and Self-Optimization Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: This module gives the agent the ability to self-reflect and improve, which is key to its long-term growth. It enables the agent to 'get smarter with use.'
# Details:
This module continuously monitors the agent's internal state and external performance, evaluating the effectiveness of current plans and actions. If it detects deviations (e.g., task failure), it triggers a 'reflection mechanism' to analyze the cause of failure and feeds insights back to the Planning and Reasoning modules to correct strategies in the next cycle. This includes real-time learning, offline deep learning from accumulated experience, and module evolution to incorporate new technologies.

Learning efficiency tests with few-shot scenarios, adaptation speed tests in new domains, knowledge retention tests, and meta-learning improvement measurement.
